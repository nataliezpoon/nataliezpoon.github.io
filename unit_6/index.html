				<h2>About the Collective</h2>
				<p>Made up of like-minded individuals with a natural affinity for meandering through life with their chins up, spirits high, and hearts yearning for the next grand excursion, a love of nature, tendency towards silliness, and great aptitude for all forms of merriment and comradery are the general principles given to the original Mount HoneyJack Conquerors atop Mount HoneyJack by the great Jojoba. Ever since, the Jojoba Collective has exuded the positive energy behind these principles and seeks to grow with further adventures into the wonderous deserts, hills, mountains, forests, and rock formations of the great American Southwest and beyond!</p>
